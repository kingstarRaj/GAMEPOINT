# GAMEPOINT
Snake Game
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Java using the Java Swing library. The game features a simple 2D interface, in which the player controls a snake that moves around a grid, eating food and growing longer with each bite. The player must avoid colliding with the walls or their own tail, which grows longer as the game progresses.

1)Clone the project repository to your local machine using git clone.

2)Open the project in NetBeans by selecting File > Open Project and choosing the project folder.

# Features
The Snake game implemented in this project includes the following features:

-A grid-based game board with adjustable size.

-A snake that moves around the board in response to player input.

-Food items that appear randomly on the board and can be eaten by the snake.

-A score counter that increases with each food item eaten.

-A game over screen that appears when the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.

-A restart option that allows the player to start a new game.

# Usage
To play the game, simply use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of the snake. The snake will move in the direction of the key that is pressed, and will continue moving until another key is pressed. The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or your own tail.

When the game is over, a message will be displayed on the screen indicating the final score. You can then choose to restart the game by clicking the "SPACE" button.
